HI, every one.I started my new project hfm(helper for management).
The goal of this project is to enable clear and quick communication between employees and to keep information organized <br><br>

the apps exists now:<br>
  *user - customers information to authintificate ...<br>
  *company - the company which wants management informations<br>
  *adress - the adresses of companies ...
  *staff - the staff, works, responsiblies for works of companies
  *page - HTML pages users make to take clear information
  *tags - HTML tags to use for pages. these tags check the Json information which come from users and give it to pages
  *responsible group - the responsible staff for any page.namely they write page information or check that it is True or false
  
the apps expected:
  *documets - the documents formed from pages. they circulate among responsible group and finally is wrote to any database(exel, sql, etc)
  *adapters - the classses to exchange information of document to any form users want
  *Writers - write informations to any databases
