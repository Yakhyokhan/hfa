# hfm
HI, every one.I started my new project hfm(helper for management).
The goal of this project is to enable clear and quick communication between employees and to keep information organized <br><br>

the apps exists now:
<ol>
  <li>user - customers information to authintificate ...
  <li>company - the company which wants management informations
  <li>adress - the adresses of companies ...
  <li>staff - the staff, works, responsiblies for works of companies
  <li>page - HTML pages users make to take clear information
  <li>tags - HTML tags to use for pages. these tags check the Json information which come from users and give it to pages<br>
  <li>responsible group - the responsible staff for any page.namely they write page information or check that it is True or false<br>
  
the apps expected:
<ol>
  <li>documets - the documents formed from pages. they circulate among responsible group and finally is wrote to any database(exel, sql, etc)<br>
  <li>adapters - the classses to exchange information of document to any form users want<br>
