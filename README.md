HI, every one.I started my new project hfm(helper for management).
The goal of this project is to enable clear and quick communication between employees and to keep information organized

the apps exists now:
<ol>
  <li>user - customers information to authintificate ...</li>
  <li>company - the company which wants management informations</li>
  <li>adress - the adresses of companies ...</li>
  <li>staff - the staff, works, responsiblies for works of companies</li>
  <li>page - HTML pages users make to take clear information</li>
  <li>tags - HTML tags to use for pages. these tags check the Json information which come from users and give it to pages</li>
  <li>responsible group - the responsible staff for any page.namely they write page information or check that it is True or false</li>
</ol>
  
the apps expected:
<ol>
  <li>documets - the documents formed from pages. they circulate among responsible group and finally is wrote to any database(exel, sql, etc)</li>
  <li>adapters - the classses to exchange information of document to any form users want</li>
